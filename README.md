# VSCode Foundry Test Runner â€¢ [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-brown.svg?label=license)](https://github.com/PraneshASP/vscode-foundry-test-adapter/blob/main/LICENSE)

An extension for VSCode editor to easily explore and run tests using the [foundry framework](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry). This is an adapter that is intended to work with VSCode's [native Test Explorer API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/testing).

> Note: This adapter is in a very early stage. Beta testers are welcome!

---

### Features at a glance:

- Displays a Test Explorer in the Test view of VS Code's sidebar with all detected tests and suites along with their state.
- Adds CodeLenses to your test files for running specific tests.
- Display test logs in the Test Results panel.
- Allows for verbosity configuration.
- Exclude test files and test functions.

## Blocked

- [ ] Run tests in debug mode - this requires DAP, the best chance of this existing is [rethnet](https://medium.com/nomic-foundation-blog/slang-rethnet-2ad465fd7880).
- [ ] Coverage - Foundry has a separate command for this (`forge coverage --report lcov`), which can be viewed using the [Coverage Gutters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters) extension.
